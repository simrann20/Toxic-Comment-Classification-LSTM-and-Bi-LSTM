# Toxic Comment Classification using LSTM and Bi-LSTM

In this project, we proposed a multi-label classification model using LSTM and Bi-LSTM to classify the various toxic comments into six classes namely toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult and identity hate.

## About the Dataset
The dataset for this project is taken from Kaggle and is provided by the Conversation AI team (a research initiative co-founded by Jigsaw and Google). Word Embedding is performed to get insights from the previous research works. In this project, Glove.6B.300D is used which contain 6 billion tokens and each token is represented by 300D vector representation.

The following figure shows the distribution of the comments into six labels according to the length.
